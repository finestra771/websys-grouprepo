## Zhimin ReadMe
I began this lab by carefully reading through Articles I–IV of the U.S. Constitution and the first few amendments. My main goal was to translate the text into plain, modern English while keeping the original meaning intact. To make this manageable, I used a three-part structure for each section from what it means, why it matters, and a basic annotated version of what I’m reading. Once I tested this structure on Article I, Section 1, I found it worked smoothly, so I applied it consistently throughout the rest of the assignment.
I struggled with a few parts of the assignment which pushed me to think harder. I needed to balance the clarity and detail of the legal language and avoid oversimplifying the document to drift apart from its original meaning. There was also some parts and clauses of the constitution like the 3-5ths compromise which are no longer active, but I chose to still summarize them as originally written. Also there are the 2nd,3rd, and 4th amendments which are still debated today, where I try to keep my explanations neutral and unbiased.
