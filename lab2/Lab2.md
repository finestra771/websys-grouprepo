## Lab2 Documentation

### Jodie Cho
For this lab I worked on making the html and css frame, and overall design of the website. I picked the color scheme of the US flag to make it look like constitution, and made a toggle of the Articles and Amendments. I had trouble making the javascript for articles, to make them animate when we clicked on it. I found some references on google, especially on W3schools. There, I could fine some references for css and javascript, and fixed the problem, making the toggles collapsible.


### Oliver Crotty
For this lab I worked on writing annotations for article 2 of the constitution and the eighth through tenth amendments. To make it more understandable I had to describe what each section meant in relation to the function of the government. I had to spend more time researching how interpretations of some sections had developed over the history of the country and how it has been historically applied.

### SoMey Dong
For this lab I was assigned to annotate parts of the Constituion. I annotated Article III and Amendments Five-Seven. As I read over the document, I highlighted the important parts, and broke it down to be more digestable. When I encountered parts I was unsure of I referenced other websites such as the 5th and 6th amendments that lead to the creation of Miranda Rights. Combining my summarization with other sources helped add more detail to the explanation. I could explain how the amendments affect us today, and how the constitution was used to create modern laws even though it is centeries old.

### Dathan Lang
For this lab, I was given the task to code the annotations as well as make the site more accesible for users. To do this, I spent time researching JQuery api so I could learn how to do animations. These include having sections expand and contract, having modes to stop popup annotations if they get annoying, and also have links that scroll down to the correct area of the page. Furthermore, I helped design a bit of the styling, mainly the navigation bar which was done by having its position be fixed, and also adding color gradients. Finally, I concluded my work by helping to format some of my groupmates analysis and do proofreading.

### Zhimin Jiang
I began this lab by carefully reading through Articles I–IV of the U.S. Constitution and the first few amendments. My main goal was to translate the text into plain, modern English while keeping the original meaning intact. To make this manageable, I used a three-part structure for each section from what it means, why it matters, and a basic annotated version of what I’m reading. Once I tested this structure on Article I, Section 1, I found it worked smoothly, so I applied it consistently throughout the rest of the assignment.
I struggled with a few parts of the assignment which pushed me to think harder. I needed to balance the clarity and detail of the legal language and avoid oversimplifying the document to drift apart from its original meaning. There was also some parts and clauses of the constitution like the 3-5ths compromise which are no longer active, but I chose to still summarize them as originally written. Also there are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th amendments which are still debated today, where I try to keep my explanations neutral and unbiased.
