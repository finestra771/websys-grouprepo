                        prevents lawmaking by the executive/judicial branches. Annotated : Section 1 vests all of the powers of 
                        lawmaking of the federal government with a bicameral legislature (House and Senate). It achieves a clear 
                        division of powers with the legislature being granted legislative power. It also introduces checks and 
                        balances as a subsequent provision and amendments prohibit how Congress can exercise this power.">

                        allocated across the states based on a national census. It contains Founding Era language about the 
                        three‑fifths compromise (since abolished) and procedures for handling vacancies. It also grants the

                    state legislatures (changed through the 17th Amendment to direct election); VP presides and breaks 
                    ties; Senate holds impeachments; Chief Justice sits during President's trial; 2/3 vote convicts; penalties

                    he or she represents—and invests the Vice President as presiding officer and as tie‑breaker. It assigns the 
                    Senate an exclusive role of trying impeachments (with the Chief Justice presiding at presidential trials) and 
                    a vote of at least two‑thirds or more to convict with punishment no greater than removal/disqualification with 
                    potential subsequent criminal prosecution. It also allows appointments until a replacement can be elected

                    The last clause have since become obsolete.
                    The Privileges and Immunities Clause grants the citizens of one state the same privileges and immunities of the 
                    citizens of another state. This clause was made to prevent discrimination in towards citizens of different states.
                    The Interstate Extradition Clause makes it so that if a person was accused of a crime in one state, they can't 
                    simply just flee to another state. The Governor of the state from which the accused fled and request for their 
                    return from the asylum state. Notably though, this clause is not self-executing and the Constitution does not 
                    provide Congress to implement it. 
                    A following act, known as the Extradition Act, was pass later on that required governors of each state to return 
                    the accused upon lawful demand from another state. However, in Kentucky v. Dennison, the Supreme Court held that 
                    this was more of a moral duty of the state and that the federal government had no power to enforce it. This 
                    decision was later overrules in 1987, and the current version allow states to invoke the power of the federal 
                    courts to enforce the act against asylum state officers. 
                    The last clause, the Fugitive Slavery Clause, had been nullified by the Thirteenth Amendment's abolition of slavery.

                    The US Constitution was drafted between May and September 1787 during the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and signed on September 17, 
                    1787. However, it wasn’t officially ratified until 1788, when the ninth state (New Hampshire) approved it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before the Constitution, the newly independent United States was governed under the Articles of Confederation, which essentially acted as a 
                    “league of friendship” between the thirteen states. Under the Articles, most of the power remained with the states, while the central government 
                    lacked the power to regulate commerce, raise a national army, or even collect taxes. This limited design stemmed from a fear of centralized 
                    authority. The states had just fought a war against what they saw as an oppressive British monarchy and so were determined to avoid concentrating 
                    too much power in a single national government—even if it made the country harder to govern. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This weakness in the central government, however, became increasingly difficult to ignore, especially in the face of growing unrest. Eventually, 
                    in August 1786, a group of struggling farmers in Massachusetts—many of whom were former Revolutionary War soldiers—rose up in protest over debt, 
                    taxes, and the fear of losing their land. This event, known as Shay’s Rebellion, lasted until February 1787, when the Massachusetts militia put 
                    it down. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a direct result, the Constitutional Convention—also known as the Philadelphia Convention of 1787—was called into action. At the convention, 
                    several plans were proposed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Virginia Plan, proposed by Edmund Randolph and James Madison, called for a government with three branches—executive, legislative, and 
                        judicial—and a bicameral legislature based on population. The three branches would be structured to check each other, leading to a system 
                        of checks and balances where no one branch held all the power over the federal government. Additionally, the plan gave the federal government 
                        the power to veto state laws, effectively annihilating the idea of state sovereignty.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The New Jersey Plan, proposed by William Paterson, took a more modest approach, suggesting reforms to the Articles that gave the federal 
                        government the power to easily raise revenue and regulate commerce while preserving state power. Each state would have equal representation 
                        in a unicameral legislature, and the acts of Congress and ratified treaties would be treated as the Supreme Law. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hamilton’s Plan, proposed by Alexander Hamilton, was the most ambitious—and controversial. He envisioned a strong central government with a 
                        president and senators serving for life, a system that many feared resembled a monarchy. This wasn’t too surprising given Hamilton’s belief 
                        that the British government was the best in the world. He wanted to model the new American government after it, even if it meant sacrificing 
                        some revolutionary ideals about avoiding kings and concentrated power. No thanks, my guy. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Beyond the discussion on structure, one of the most contentious issues was over representation and slavery. Southern states had larger 
                    populations—in part because of their enslaved population—and wanted representation based on total population. Northern states, however, worried 
                    that this would unfairly shift control to the South, especially since enslaved people had no rights and could not vote. States like Pennsylvania, 
                    home to many Quakers who were early opponents of slavery, argued that enslaved people should not count fully for representation. In the end, the 
                    resulting Three-Fifths Compromise counted each enslaved person as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of taxation and representation, 
                    striking a tense balance between the North and the South.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the debate over slavery did not end there. While the Constitution avoided directly addressing slavery in clear terms, the tensions between 
                    the states remained obvious. The issue would continue to divide the states and would eventually resurface in far more serious conflicts in the 
                    decades to come. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These challenges reflect deeper philosophical and legal influences that shaped the Constitution’s framework. Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke 
                    argued that individuals have natural rights—those of life, liberty, and property—and that governments derive their authority from the consent of the 
                    governed. If a government violates those rights, the people have the right to replace it. These ideas deeply influenced both the Declaration of 
                    Independence and the Constitution. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time, older legal precedents like the Magna Carta contributed to American ideas of limited government and due process. The Magna Carta 
                    was a charter of rights agreed to by King John of England in 1215 and introduced the idea that no one—not even kings—are above the law. It asserted 
                    that the law of the land applies to everyone and that certain rights and liberties were so fundamental that violating them constituted an abuse of 
                    governmental power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, while these principles helped shape the Constitution, not everyone agreed on whether the document went far enough to protect individual 
                    rights. This disagreement gave rise to fierce debates between Federalists, who supported the new Constitution, and the Anti-Federalists, who feared 
                    that it gave too much power to the central government. At the heart of it all remained the question: could a strong central government still guarantee 
                    the personal freedoms Americans had fought to secure?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To defend the new Constitution and persuade the public of its merits, Federalist leaders—Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay—wrote a series 
                    of essays known as the Federalist Papers and published them under the pseudonym Publius in New York newspapers. These 85 essays—51 of which were written 
                    by Hamilton—argued for the necessity of a stronger national government while emphasizing the built-in system of checks and balances designed to prevent 
                    tyranny. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the opposing side, the Anti-Federalists wrote their own essays criticizing the Constitution. One of the most well-known voices was Brutus—a pseudonym 
                    used by an unknown author—who argued that the proposed government would overpower the states and lack clear protections for personal freedoms. Brutus 
                    warned that the Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, Section 8) and Supremacy Clause (Article VI) would give Congress nearly unlimited authority, 
                    making it difficult to restrain federal power once it expanded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These concerns resonated with many Americans and ultimately led to the inclusion of the Bill of Rights—the first ten amendments to the Constitution—which 
                    guaranteed freedoms like speech, religion, and due process. With the addition of the Bill of Rights, the Federalists won the fight, and the Constitution 
                    was ratified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, the ratification of the Constitution marked a turning point in American history, acting as an experience in the balancing of power, liberty, 
                    and unity across a diverse set of states. The compromises made in Philadelphia in 1787 were far from perfect and left many debates unresolved—particularly 
                    around slavery and federal authority. Still, it laid the foundation for a national government that would continue to evolve and shape the nation’s future. 
                </p>

                    Just a few years later, this new system would be tested during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, when farmers in western Pennsylvania protested a federal tax 
                    on whiskey. Unlike under the Articles of Confederation, the federal government now had the authority to act decisively. Federal troops under President George 
                    Washington suppressed the rebellion effectively without significant violence, demonstrating that the national government not only had the power to enforce 
                    its laws but also the legitimacy to maintain order. It was a defining moment that proved the Constitution was more than just words on paper—it was a 
                    functioning framework, capable of holding the nation together.
