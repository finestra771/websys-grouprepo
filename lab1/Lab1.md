Here's a running log of how lab1 was created and made:
- Jodie, our project manager, created the wireframe for the landing page and developed the projects part of it. 
- Dathan, our main developer, developed the rest of the landing page, following the wireframe Jodie created. 
- SoMey, our resident graphics designer, created the logo for the team.
- Oliver, our writer, wrote the descriptions for our projects and made edits to the rest of the site. 
- Zhimin, our editor, reviewed styling of the site.
- Lala, our documenter, logged the progress of the team and made minor edits to the rest of the site.
